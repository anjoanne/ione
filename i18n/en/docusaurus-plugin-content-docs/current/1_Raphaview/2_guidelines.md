## Precautions

I-Rapha View™ only supports medical images in DICOM format, so a basic understanding of DICOM is required. For more information on DICOM, please refer to http://dicom.nema.org.

To use I-Rapha View™, DICOM-format medical images must first be transferred to the server or gateway where I-Rapha View™ is installed. For details on image transfer, please refer to the Medical Image Upload DICOM Import section.
